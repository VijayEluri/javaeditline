EditLine Interface for Java
===========================

## Introduction

This library provides a Java (JNI) interface to the [Editline][editline]
library, which is available on BSD systems and Mac OS X, and can be
installed on most Linux systems. Editline is a replacement for the
[GNU Readline][readline]
library, with a more liberal BSD-style license. Linking
Editline into your code (and, similarly, using this Java interface to it)
will not change the license you have assigned to your code.

Please see the [Java EditLine web page][] for documentation and build
instructions.
