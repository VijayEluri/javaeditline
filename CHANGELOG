Java EditLine Change Log
===========================================================================

Version 0.3 (...)

- Addressed Issue #1: When there are multiple possible completions for a
  string, the completion logic now adds the common leading substring (if any)
  to the buffer.
- Messages emitted by the JNI code now to go stderr, not stdout.
- The maximum number of displayed possible completions can now be set via
  accessor methods on the EditLine class. (Previously, it was hard-coded to
  30.)
- The caller can now provide its own class to show matching completions,
  when multiple completion choices are possible.
- Fixed getMaxHistory() to return the correct value.
