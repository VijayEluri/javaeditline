<h1>EditLine Interface for Java</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This library provides a Java (JNI) interface to the <a href="http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/">Editline</a>
library, which is available on BSD systems and Mac OS X, and can be
installed on most Linux systems. Editline is a replacement for the <a href="http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">GNU
Readline</a> library, with a more liberal BSD-style license. Linking
Editline into your code (and, similarly, using this Java interface to it)
will not change the license you have assigned to your code.</p>

<h2>Using the Library</h2>

<p>An <code>EditLine</code> object is instantiated via a factory method. The finalizer
for the returned object restores the terminal environment, if you don't do
it yourself--but you're better off doing it yourself. Here's the typical
usage pattern:</p>

<pre><code>import org.clapper.editline.EditLine

public class MyProgram
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        EditLine el = EditLine.init("myprogram")
        try
        {
            el.setPrompt("myprogram? ");
            el.setHistorySize(1024);

            String line;
            while ((line = el.getLine()) != null)
            {
                // ...
            }

            System.exit(0);
        }
        finally
        {
            el.cleanup();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

<p>This package is only known to work on Unix-like operating systems. I have
tested it on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu Linux 9, with the <a href="http://www.openjdk.org/">OpenJDK 6</a> and the Sun Java 6 JDKs</li>
<li>FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE, with the Diablo 1.6.0 JDK</li>
<li>Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), with the <a href="http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/static/soylatte/">SoyLatte Java 6</a> and
<a href="http://www.openjdk.org/">OpenJDK 6</a> JDKs</li>
</ul>

<p>This Java wrapper does not expose all the functionality of the underlying
Editline library.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This wrapper does not support the use of alternate file descriptors. All
Editline instances use standard input, output and error. While this
library theoretically permits multiple Editline instances to be
constructed, all such instances use the same file descriptors (which
limits the utility of having multiple instances). In practice, this is
generally not a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>This class does not currently expose the Editline library's tokenizer
functionality (e.g., the <code>tok_init()</code>, <code>tok_line()</code>, <code>tok_str()</code>,
<code>tok_reset()</code> and <code>tok_end()</code> functions).</p></li>
<li><p>Signal handling is currently omitted, as it doesn't play well with the JVM.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain Editline functions are not currently exposed, among them:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>el_insertstr()</code></li>
<li><code>el_deletestr()</code></li>
<li><code>el_set()</code></li>
<li><code>el_get()</code></li>
<li><code>el_getc()</code></li>
<li><code>el_reset()</code></li>
<li><code>el_push()</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Building Java EditLine</h2>

<p>After unpacking the source, change your working directory to <code>src</code>. The
code uses GNU <code>make</code> to build. The <code>make</code> logic is split into two pieces:</p>

<ul>
<li>A platform-independent <code>Makefile</code>.</li>
<li>Architecture-specific build definitions. These definitions are in the
<code>Makedefs.*</code> files. The suffix for those files is determined by the
<code>uname -s</code> command. There are existing definitions files for Darwin
(Mac OS X), FreeBSD, and Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to build:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type <code>uname -s</code> at the command line. If there's an existing <code>Makedefs</code> file
for your platform, you're probably fine. (You may have to edit it, if there
are errors.)</li>
<li>Install the Editline library, if necessary. This is <em>not</em> necessary on
FreeBSD or Mac OS X. For Linux distributions, you can usually find an
appropriate version of Editline in your distro's repository. For example,
for Ubuntu, you can install it with: <code>apt-get install libedit-dev</code>.</li>
<li>On FreeBSD, make sure GNU Make is installed.</li>
<li>Type <code>make</code> (<code>gmake</code> on FreeBSD). If it's successful, you'll get a
<code>libjavaeditline.so</code> shared library (<code>libjavaeditline.jnilib</code> on the Mac)
and a <code>javaeditline.jar</code> jar file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deploying Java EditLine</h2>

<p>Once you have succcessfully built Java EditLine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that the shared library (<code>libjavaeditline.jnilib</code> on the Mac,
<code>libjavaeditline.so</code> on other systems) is in your LD<em>LIBRARY</em>PATH.</li>
<li>Ensure that <code>javaeditline.jar</code> is in your CLASSPATH.</li>
</ul>

<p>That should be all you need to do.</p>
