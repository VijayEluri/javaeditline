<h1>EditLine Interface for Java</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This library provides a Java (JNI) interface to the BSD <code>editline</code> library,
which is available on BSD systems and Mac OS X, and can be installed on
most Linux systems. <code>editline</code> is a replacement for the <a href="http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">GNU Readline</a>
library, with a more liberal BSD-style license. Linking <code>editline</code> into your
code (and, similarly, using this Java interface to it) will not change the
license you have assigned to your code.</p>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

<p>This package is only known to work on Unix-like operating systems. I have
tested it on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linux (Ubuntu 9)</li>
<li>FreeBSD 8</li>
<li>Mac OS X (10.4)</li>
</ul>

<p>This Java wrapper does not expose all the functionality of the underlying
<code>editline</code> library.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This wrapper does not support the use of alternate file descriptors. All
<code>EditLine</code> instances use standard input, output and error. While this
library theoretically permits multiple <code>EditLine</code> instances to be
constructed, all such instances use the same file descriptors (which
limits the utility of having multiple instances). In practice, this is
generally not a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>This class does not currently expose the <code>editline</code> library's tokenizer
functionality (e.g., the <code>tok_init()</code>, <code>tok_line()</code>, <code>tok_str()</code>,
<code>tok_reset()</code> and <code>tok_end()</code> functions).</p></li>
<li><p>Signal handling is currently omitted, as it doesn't play well with the JVM.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain <code>editline</code> functions are not currently exposed, among them:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>el_insertstr()</code></li>
<li><code>el_deletestr()</code></li>
<li><code>el_set()</code></li>
<li><code>el_get()</code></li>
<li><code>el_getc()</code></li>
<li><code>el_reset()</code></li>
<li><code>el_push()</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>After unpacking the source, change your working directory to <code>src</code>. The code uses GNU <code>make</code> to build. The <code>make</code> logic is split into two pieces:</p>

<ul>
<li>A platform-independent <code>Makefile</code>.</li>
<li>Architecture-specific build definitions. These definitions are in the
<code>Makedefs.*</code> files. The suffix for those files is determined by the
<code>uname -s</code> command.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to build:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type <code>uname -s</code> at the command line. If there's an existing <code>Makedefs</code> file
for your platform, you're probably fine. (You may have to edit it, if there
are errors.)</li>
<li>Install the <code>editline</code> library, if necessary. This is <em>not</em> necessary on
FreeBSD or Mac OS X. For Linux distributions, you can usually find an
appropriate version of <code>editline</code> in your distro's repository. For example,
for Ubuntu: <code>apt-get install libedit-dev</code>.</li>
<li>Type <code>make</code>. If it's successfully, you'll get a shared library and a jar
file.</li>
</ul>
