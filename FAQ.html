<h1>Java EditLine FAQ</h1>

<p><strong>Why not just use <a href="http://java-readline.sourceforge.net/">Java Readline</a>?</strong></p>

<p>For several reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Java Readline doesn't expose enough information for completion. It exposes
the token being completed and the current line, but it doesn't expose the
<em>location</em> of the token. In applications that do context-sensitive
completion, not knowing the location of the token is a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Java Readline has not been updated since 2003.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Well, why don't you fix Java Readline, instead?</strong></p>

<p>Because I wanted to start fresh, with a new API.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What about <a href="http://jline.sourceforge.net/">JLine</a>?</strong></p>

<p>JLine is certainly useful, especially since it works on Unix-like systems
and on Windows. However, it isn't as functionally complete as Editline. For
instance, it isn't as configurable, and it doesn't support breadth of
editing commands that Editline supports.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Why use <a href="http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/">Editline</a>, instead of <a href="http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">GNU Readline</a>?</strong></p>

<p>Largely because of licensing. Editline is BSD-licensed, whereas GNU
Readline is GNU-licensed. The BSD license is more liberal.</p>
