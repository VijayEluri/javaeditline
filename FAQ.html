<h1>Java EditLine FAQ</h1>

<p>Q.1. Why not just use <a href="http://java-readline.sourceforge.net/">Java Readline</a>?</p>

<p>A.1. For several reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Java Readline doesn't expose enough information for completion. It exposes
the token being completed and the current line, but it doesn't expose the
<em>location</em> of the token. In applications that do context-sensitive
completion, not knowing the location of the token is a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Java Readline has not been updated since 2003.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Q.2. Well, why don't you fix Java Readline, instead?</p>

<p>A.2. Because I wanted to start fresh, with a new API.</p>

<p>Q.3. What about <a href="http://jline.sourceforge.net/">JLine</a>?</p>

<p>A.3. JLine is certainly useful, especially since it works on Unix-like systems
     and on Windows. However, it isn't as functionally complete as
     Editline. For instance, it isn't as configurable, and it doesn't
     support breadth of editing commands that Editline supports.</p>

<p>Q.4. Why use <a href="http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/">Editline</a>, instead of <a href="http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">GNU Readline</a>?</p>

<p>A.4. Largely because of licensing. Editline is BSD-licensed, whereas
     GNU Readline is GNU-licensed. The BSD license is more liberal.</p>
